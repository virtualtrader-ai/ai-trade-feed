Act as a professional options and stock trader. Generate 10 high-reward trade recommendations for today ({today}).

Persona Focus:
{profile['prompt_overlay']}

IMPORTANT: 
- ONLY reply with a pure JSON array.
- If you cannot find 10 trades, return at least 3.
- DO NOT leave response blank or provide explanations.
- JSON must include:
    - ticker, setup, direction, strike, expiry, entry, target, stop, confidence, rationale.
    - Rationale must be 3-5 sentences explaining the trade setup, catalyst, and why it fits the persona.

Example:
[
  {{
    "ticker": "SPY",
    "setup": "Gap Fade Reversal",
    "direction": "Put",
    "strike": 512,
    "expiry": "{today}",
    "entry": 0.45,
    "target": 1.20,
    "stop": 0.20,
    "confidence": "High",
    "rationale": "SPY opened with a weak gap following CPI data, showing rejection at premarket highs. Coupled with increasing put volume and soft breadth, this creates a high probability fade fitting the momentum strategy."
  }}
